                    <p>In 1986, the Angellete’s Nursery School became the SAN DIEGO PAROCHIAL SCHOOL after it was turned over to the parish authority under the Diocese of Malolos. It took its name and inspiration from San Diego de Alcala of Franciscan Order who is known for his humility, love and charity. On the same year, the school has begun to offer basic elementary education. Due to the increasing number of enrollees, the school continues to expand its area.</p>
                    <p>With the growing reputation of its teaching and calling for continuity for a higher level of education, the High School Department was opened in 1995, The inauguration of the school gymnasium in March 16, 1997 took place with the officiating Bishop of Malolos, Bishop Rolando Tria Tirona. The school was finally recognized on April 11, 2001 by the Department of Education as private institution under License No. S-002 Series of 2001. Rev. Fr. Epitacio V. Castro was then School Director.</p>
                    <p>Year 2007, additional buildings at the Elementary as well as High school Department were constructed due to its increasing population. Under the principalship of Sr. Mary Grace M. Gregorio, O.P., the school continues to be known in Valenzuela, not only because of being a Catholic School but because of its achievements in the academic, cultural and also in sports.</p>
                    <p>By the School Year 2010–2011, the School Principal, Sr. Susana B. Bundoc, O.P. made a lot of improvement in the school facilities, namely: Science Laboratory, TLE Room/Home Economics Room and the new Guidance Office all housed at the High School new building.</p>
